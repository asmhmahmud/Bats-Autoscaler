# Bats-Autoscaler
As a system, we build a \emph{fully-automated} \OurAlg autoscaler service on Windows Azure. \OurAlg autoscaler only requires user inputs on the desired delay performance and budget of their applications. It manages the performance monitoring, resource planning, and scaling of user applications automatically. We also combine \OurAlg algorithm with a reactive module that monitors runtime performance and handles workload burstiness. We show that the modular design of \OurAlg autoscaler makes its implementation easily adaptable to other cloud platforms such as Amazon EC2.
