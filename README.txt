Summary of the project: 
In this project, we developed a new autoscaling system for Azure cloud service, called BATS (Budget-constrained AuToScaling), which optimizes delay performance while meeting long-term budget constraints given by a cloud service user. We build BATS autoscaler as a user-friendly service for running applications on Windows Azure. The experimental results show that (1) BATS reduces the average delay by up to 34%, and (2) compared with the state-of-art threshold-based autoscaling solutions, BATS achieves both lower cost and less delay. We also run  discrete simulation studies to complement the implementation results, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm for reducing both average and tail latency under various workloads and scenarios.
